### Auto Price Analytics: Understanding the factors influencing car prices
This project is an analysis of the relationship between various features of a car and its MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price). The automobile industry is a highly competitive market, and manufacturers are constantly looking for ways to optimize their pricing strategies to increase sales and profits. By understanding the relationship between car features and MSRP, manufacturers can make informed decisions about how to price their vehicles in order to stay competitive and increase their bottom line.

The goal of this project is to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on MSRP, using a large dataset of car features and prices. The dataset includes information on the make and model of the car, engine horsepower, fuel type, transmission type, number of doors, vehicle size, and more.

In this project, we start by performing data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure that the data is in a format that can be analyzed. We then move on to explore the relationship between the different features and MSRP using various plotting techniques such as scatter plots and bar plots. In the end, we used linear regression models to predict the MSRP of a car based on its features.

We found out that Engine horsepower, Year and Highway MPG are higly related features with MSRP. Also, Maker, Engine Fuel Type, Transmission Type, Driven_Wheels, Vehicle Size, and New Vehicle Style are also related with MSRP.

A few interesting facts and numbers from this analysis include:

-Cars with higher engine horsepower tend to have higher MSRPs<br>
-Cars from certain manufacturers, such as Chevrolet and Volkswagen, tend to have higher MSRPs on average than cars from other manufacturers<br>
-Cars with certain fuel types, such as diesel and natural gas, tend to have higher MSRPs than cars with other fuel types<br>
-Cars with certain transmission types, such as automated manual and direct drive, tend to have higher MSRPs than cars with other transmission types<br>
-Cars with certain drive wheels, such as all wheel drive and four wheel drive, tend to have higher MSRPs than cars with other drive wheels<br>

In conclusion, this project provides valuable insights into the relationship between car features and MSRP, which can be used by manufacturers to make informed decisions about pricing their vehicles. By understanding these relationships, manufacturers can optimize their pricing strategies to increase sales and profits.
